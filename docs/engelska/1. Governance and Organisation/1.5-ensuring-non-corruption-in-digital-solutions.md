This is a crucial ethical point. A political movement promoting technological solutions must have strong safeguards against conflicts of interest and unfair advantages. Here's how this could be approached:

1. **Transparent Governance**
- Clear separation between political roles and business interests
- Public disclosure of all connections between party members and tech companies
- Independent oversight committees
- Open source requirements for publicly promoted solutions

2. **Fair Competition Framework**
- Technology-neutral policies that specify outcomes rather than specific solutions
- Equal opportunity for all companies/projects meeting ethical and technical standards
- Support for open standards and interoperability
- Anti-monopoly measures specifically designed for digital platforms

3. **Democratic Tech Assessment**
- Community involvement in evaluating and choosing technological solutions
- Public review periods for proposed implementations
- Multiple pilot projects with different approaches
- Clear metrics for success defined before implementation

4. **Platform Cooperativism**
- Encourage cooperative ownership models for essential digital infrastructure
- Support for community-owned and operated platforms
- Focus on decentralized solutions where appropriate
- Prevent capture by private interests

5. **Ethical Guidelines**
- Clear principles for when and how technology should be deployed
- Privacy-by-design requirements
- Focus on empowering communities rather than creating dependencies
- Commitment to maintaining alternatives to digital solutions

The goal would be to create an ecosystem where:
- Multiple solutions can coexist and compete fairly
- Communities have real choice in what they adopt
- Innovation is encouraged while preventing predatory practices
- Public interest is protected through transparency and accountability
