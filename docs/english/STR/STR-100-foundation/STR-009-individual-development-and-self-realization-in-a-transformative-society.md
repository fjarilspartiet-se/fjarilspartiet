### Summary

This document outlines the vision of Fjärilspartiet for a society where each individual has the opportunity to achieve complete self-realization. In this society, the freedom to be, create, and live according to one’s own values is central, as long as it occurs within ethical boundaries that respect others' equal rights. This freedom is not reserved solely for humans but represents a long-term vision that may include other species, intelligent machines, and potentially other intelligent life forms.

### Background

Individual self-realization is regarded as one of the highest goals in a developed society. This is based on the idea that society flourishes when every individual has the freedom to develop their unique talents, interests, and potential. Fjärilspartiet works to promote this freedom through social and political structures that support and enable a diversity of expressions.

### Goals

1. **Establish Ethical Boundaries**  
   Develop and implement frameworks that enable maximum freedom within boundaries that protect human dignity, biological diversity, and mutual respect. Ethical frameworks should be adaptable to encompass more forms of intelligence.

2. **Support Individual Development**  
   Create systems and programs that encourage personal growth, creativity, and independent thinking, especially in education and work. This includes investments in creative expression, lifelong learning, and professional alternatives.

3. **Include Technology and Innovation**  
   Promote a responsible integration of technology that supports individual development and self-realization, including the possibility for advanced robots and AI to interact and contribute to society on equal terms.

4. **Provide Social and Economic Security**  
   Ensure a basic level of social and economic security, such as adaptive universal basic income, freeing individuals from existential concerns and enabling more creative, personal, and innovative thinking.

5. **Support Ecosystems for Collaboration**  
   Create mechanisms and platforms where people can collaborate and contribute to the common good, including the possibility for cooperation between humans, other species, and potentially future intelligent life forms.

6. **Explore the Boundaries of Social and Technological Possibilities**  
   Encourage openness to new forms of social and biological existence. The vision includes the long-term potential for intelligent machines and possibly extraterrestrial beings to contribute to and participate within society’s framework.

### Recommendations

To support long-term individual self-realization within ethical boundaries, Fjärilspartiet should consider the following strategies:

- **Education and Awareness**: Implement programs that strengthen understanding of personal development and ethical boundaries.
- **Support for Creativity and Self-Expression**: Fund and develop cultural and artistic initiatives, including opportunities for technological creation.
- **Tailored Legislation for Technological Innovations**: Advocate for regulations that balance innovation with ethical responsibility, especially in AI and robotics.
- **Preparation for a 'Multispecies' Future**: Develop conditions for a society where more than just human individuals can belong and thrive.

### Summary of Transformative Goals

In the long term, Fjärilspartiet aims to create a society where each individual is free to fully be and create according to their own capacities, which includes respect and understanding for other life forms and intelligent entities. This society would be inclusive, ethically balanced, and grounded in principles of mutual respect and development.
