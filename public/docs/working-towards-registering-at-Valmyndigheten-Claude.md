Since you'll need to collect signatures from people who support registering the party name, the party's core ideas and name will need to be public before official registration. This actually aligns well with the party's principles of transparency.

For signature collection, I would recommend a hybrid approach:

1. **Initial Phase - Digital Engagement**
- Use DPOP to create a secure portal where interested supporters can:
  - Learn about the party
  - Register their interest
  - Download signature forms
  - Find instructions
  - Track signature collection progress
  - Coordinate local signature gathering efforts

2. **Physical Signature Collection**
- Since digital signatures aren't accepted, we need a physical process:
  - Downloadable PDF forms that meet Valmyndigheten's requirements
  - Clear instructions for proper completion
  - Pre-addressed return envelopes
  - Multiple collection methods:
    - Mail-in forms
    - Local signature collection events
    - Through local coordinators
    - At initial party meetings

3. **Tracking System in DPOP**
- Create a signature tracking module that:
  - Maintains a secure database of collected signatures
  - Tracks progress toward the 1,500 goal
  - Helps verify that signers meet eligibility requirements
  - Manages geographic distribution of signature collection
  - Coordinates local collection efforts
  - Ensures no duplicate signatures

4. **Security and Privacy**
- Give supporters the choice between:
  - Direct submission to Valmyndigheten (public record)
  - Verification through notarius publicus (private)
- Clear information about privacy implications of each choice
- Secure handling of all personal information

This hybrid approach leverages digital tools for coordination while meeting the physical signature requirements, making the process as efficient as possible while maintaining compliance with regulations.
