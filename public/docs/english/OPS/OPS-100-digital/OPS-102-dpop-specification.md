# Digital Party Operations Platform (DPOP)
## Technical Specification v0.1

### Overview
DPOP is an open-source platform built on CosmicSyncCore to facilitate democratic party operations while maintaining security, transparency, and resilience. The platform emphasizes decentralized control, offline capabilities, and seamless integration with traditional democratic processes.

   - Backup procedures for all critical functions
   - Cross-platform accessibility

3. **Democratic By Design**
   - Transparent processes
   - Auditable decisions
   - Equal access
   - Privacy protection
