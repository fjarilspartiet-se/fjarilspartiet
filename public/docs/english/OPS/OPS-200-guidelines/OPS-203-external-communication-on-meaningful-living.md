# External Communication on Individual Autonomy and Development Opportunities

## Purpose
In all external communication, we emphasize the importance of individual autonomy and opportunities for personal development as central aspects of our policy. Our vision is to create a society where people have true freedom to shape their lives and develop according to their own choices. By highlighting self-determination and development opportunities in our societal framework, we aim to showcase how our political decisions, societal construction, and legislation contribute to creating better conditions for everyone.

## Examples and Practical Approaches
- **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**: A concrete example where our policy contributes to genuine freedom of choice by providing individuals with the financial security to make their own choices, develop themselves, and engage in society in ways that suit them.
- **Positive view on work and societal contributions**: In communication regarding AUBI and other initiatives, we can highlight examples of how people can contribute to society in various ways — from volunteer work and creative projects to starting social initiatives or sharing their knowledge and experience with others.

## Communication Strategy
- Use social media, press releases, and public events to highlight stories of individuals who have been able to realize their goals through increased autonomy and support for personal development.
- Strengthen connections with local communities through workshops and dialogues where individual freedom and development opportunities are discussed and anchored in local contexts.
- Be clear and inclusive in our communication to show that personal development and self-determination are accessible to everyone, regardless of background or life situation.
