# Fjärilspartiet's Living Symbol
## A Guide to Our Butterfly Identity

### Why a Butterfly?

Fjärilspartiet sees Swedish democracy as a beautiful meadow, where different political parties are like diverse flowers - each with its own vital role and right to exist. In this meadow, we choose to be like a butterfly: helping ideas flow between different perspectives, supporting the whole ecosystem to flourish, and demonstrating the power of transformation.

### Our Four Stages

Like a butterfly, our organization grows through natural stages:

1. **Egg Stage**
   - Where we are now
   - Building our foundation
   - Preparing for growth
   - Setting strong values

2. **Caterpillar Stage**
   - Active learning
   - Gathering resources
   - Growing steadily
   - Building strength

3. **Chrysalis Stage**
   - Deep transformation
   - Internal development
   - Preparing for emergence
   - Reorganizing for the future

4. **Butterfly Stage**
   - Full activity
   - Connecting communities
   - Sharing ideas
   - Enabling positive change

### What This Means for You

When you see our butterfly symbol, remember:
- We're on a journey of continuous growth
- Every stage has its purpose
- Change is natural and necessary
- We're all part of the same ecosystem
