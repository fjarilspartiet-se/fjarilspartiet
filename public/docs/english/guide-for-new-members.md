# Guide for New Members of FjÃ¤rilspartiet

A warm welcome to FjÃ¤rilspartiet! ðŸ¦‹ We are glad that you have chosen to explore and perhaps contribute to our vision of systemic societal renewal. FjÃ¤rilspartiet is a place for independent thinking and free developmentâ€”a place where you are encouraged to be yourself and contribute on your own terms.

This guide will help you get started and find your role in our community. You can begin by exploring our fundamental ideas, engaging in dialogues and meetings, and becoming part of technical or local initiatives. Until DPOP is launched, we will have an open structure where everyone can contribute and find their own path to involvement.

## Step 1: Explore FjÃ¤rilspartiet's Documents and Policy Framework

Our documents are a living platform for understanding and shaping the partyâ€™s vision, goals, and methods. To gain insight into our core initiatives, we recommend starting with the following key areas:

- **Adaptive Governance and Holistic Welfare**
- **AUBI â€“ Adaptive Universal Basic Income**
- **Ecological Sustainability and Economic Innovation**
- **Democratic Renewal through Digital Citizen Participation**

You can find these documents on Google Drive [https://tinyurl.com/fjarilspartiets-dokument](https://tinyurl.com/fjarilspartiets-dokument) and GitHub [https://github.com/BjornKennethHolmstrom/fjarilspartiet](https://github.com/BjornKennethHolmstrom/fjarilspartiet) and also request them via email. In the future they will be available through the party's digital platform (based on DPOP), and probably on a website. 
We always welcome your reflections and ideas to improve our policies, as we believe every member plays an active role in the development of FjÃ¤rilspartiet.

## Step 2: Participate in Dialogues and Discussion Forums

To create an open and dynamic environment, we encourage our members to initiate discussion forums, workshops, and meetings, both locally and digitally. Our guide **MEM-102: Organizing Meetings** can help you understand how to start or participate in various types of discussions and meeting formats.

Through these meetings, you can:
- **Share your reflections and insights** on our core principles
- **Discuss current societal issues** from diverse perspectives
- **Contribute new ideas and solutions** to enhance and expand our policy areas

Organizing self-directed and open discussions is an important part of FjÃ¤rilspartietâ€™s engagement. Itâ€™s about fostering a lively dialogue where all voices can be heard and inspire each other.

## Step 3: Get Involved in Technical and Digital Projects

We are developing several technical initiatives that will support FjÃ¤rilspartietâ€™s vision of a more inclusive and direct democratic society. Here are some of the projects we are working on:

- **DPOP â€“ Digital Party Operations Platform**  
  A digital tool for the party's internal work, communication, and decision-making, which will be launched in the future.

- **DidiS â€“ Direct Democracy in Sweden**  
  A platform for direct democracy in Sweden that enables citizensâ€™ participation in decision-making processes.

- **FUN(TIME) â€“ Freedom and Unity Network (Through Independent Meaningful Effort)**  
  A network project aimed at promoting freedom, community, and meaningful engagement through self-organizing efforts.

Technical experience is welcome, but we also value curiosity and the desire to learn. **MEM-103: Contribute Technically** describes how you can contribute to our digital projects. We use tools such as AI and ChatGPT to foster creativity and development, and we believe that technology, when used ethically, can be a positive force for societal change.

## Step 4: Contribute Locally and in Community Dialogue

FjÃ¤rilspartiet encourages local initiatives and engaging community dialogue. Our guides help you understand how to start or participate in initiatives that are meaningful to you and your local area:

- **MEM-104: Local Initiatives** â€“ Basic guide for starting and running local projects.
- **MEM-105: Research and Policy Development** â€“ How you can contribute to the partyâ€™s policy development through research and analysis.
- **MEM-106: Communication and Community Dialogue** â€“ Guide for effective communication to share our ideas.
- **MEM-107: Scaling and Synergies** â€“ How different initiatives can grow and collaborate for greater impact.

With these documents, you can, for example, organize local projects and participate in community dialogue, contribute with analysis and research, and help spread the message of FjÃ¤rilspartiet.

## Step 5: Preparation for DPOP and Future Development

Once DPOP is launched, it will become the basis for our central platform for digital democracy and member engagement. There, you will be able to participate in decision-making processes, collaborate with other members, and be involved in the growth and development of FjÃ¤rilspartiet. Until then, we are using existing communication channels and our MED documents to ensure a smooth and productive start for new members.

We look forward to getting to know you and seeing what you can bring to FjÃ¤rilspartiet. Your unique perspective, willingness, and commitment make us stronger and richer as a community. Donâ€™t hesitate to explore the MED documents that interest you most and reach out if you have questions or ideas.
