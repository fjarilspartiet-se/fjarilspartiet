### **4.3.2 Healthcare Framework**

#### Vision
To ensure an equitable and efficient healthcare system where everyone, regardless of background, has access to high-quality, patient-centered, and evidence-based care.

#### Fundamental Principles
1. **Accessibility for All** – No one should be prevented from receiving healthcare due to financial, geographic, or social factors.
2. **Patient-Centered Care** – The patient's needs and preferences are central to decision-making in healthcare.
3. **Efficient Resource Management** – Healthcare resources are allocated and utilized optimally to provide the highest possible quality of care.

#### Key Components
1. **Strengthening Primary Care**
   - Resources for primary care to support early stages of illness and prevent acute care needs.
   - Improved coordination between primary and specialist care to minimize wait times and reduce redundancy.

2. **Emergency Care and Crisis Preparedness**
   - More resources for emergency care, especially in rural and remote areas.
   - Development of crisis preparedness and a national plan to manage sudden healthcare needs and health crises.

3. **Specialized Care and Collaboration**
   - Efficient handling of the referral system for faster access to specialist care.
   - National and international collaborations to increase knowledge sharing and research exchange.

4. **Innovation and Digitalization**
   - Investment in digital healthcare solutions like telemedicine and remote monitoring to reach more patients.
   - Modernization of record-keeping systems and integrated health information for smoother patient management.

#### Monitoring and Quality Assurance
- **Quality Measurements** to ensure healthcare meets established standards.
- **Patient Satisfaction Surveys** for continuous improvement of care quality.
- **National Healthcare Oversight System** that monitors resources, quality, and cost-efficiency in healthcare.
