**B. Leader-Led Mode**  
- Used in crisis situations  
- Time-limited mandate  
- Clear accountability  
- Requirement for transparent documentation  

**C. Consensus Mode**  
- For decisions of principle  
- Focus on dialogue process  
- Striving for unanimity  
- Clear processes for conflict resolution
