#### **Introduction**  
This document outlines the Butterfly Party’s framework for climate resilience and biodiversity, with the goal of creating a robust, sustainable society that respects and enhances the natural environment. We recognize that a cohesive approach to climate and biodiversity efforts is crucial for our long-term well-being and for the planet's ecological balance.

#### **Goals and Guidelines for Climate Resilience**

1. **Enhanced Community Resilience**  
   - Integrate climate-adapted strategies into urban planning and infrastructure.
   - Encourage initiatives that reduce the vulnerability of our urban and rural communities.

2. **Development of Renewable Energy**  
   - Increase investments in renewable energy sources with the goal of achieving energy neutrality by 2035.
   - Implement incentives for individuals and businesses to switch to renewable energy.

3. **Promotion of Climate-Smart Agriculture**  
   - Support agricultural methods that reduce emissions, preserve soil quality, and promote biodiversity.
   - Support the transition to regenerative agriculture that restores ecosystems and soil biology.

4. **Climate Communication and Education**  
   - Develop national and local educational initiatives to increase understanding of the effects of climate change.
   - Engage the community through transparency and reliable sources of climate data.

#### **Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity**

1. **Protected Areas and Ecosystem Restoration**  
   - Prioritize identifying and expanding protected natural areas, including critical habitats for endangered species.
   - Implement plans to restore degraded or lost ecosystems.

2. **Native Species and Biodiversity**  
   - Promote native biodiversity through conservation and restoration of natural habitats.
   - Counteract the invasion of non-native species that threaten native ecosystems.

3. **Sustainable Use of Natural Resources**  
   - Establish legislation to protect natural resources and promote sustainable forestry and fishing practices.
   - Strengthen recycling programs and reduce waste from consumption and production.

#### **Economic Framework and Funding**

1. **Ecosystem Services as an Economic Factor**  
   - Qualify ecosystem services in economic terms to demonstrate their value to society.
   - Support financial incentives for companies to protect and support biodiversity.

2. **Funding for Climate and Biodiversity Initiatives**  
   - Allocate a percentage of GDP for annual investments in climate and biodiversity projects.
   - Set up a climate fund to finance research and development of sustainable solutions and protection strategies.

#### **Implementation and Monitoring**

1. **Measurement and Reporting of Climate and Biodiversity Data**  
   - Establish a national database for climate and biodiversity indicators with annual reports on progress.
   - Collaborate with international organizations to coordinate and compare climate and biodiversity data.

2. **Feedback and Revision System**  
   - Introduce a system for continuous feedback that can be applied to new environmental challenges and opportunities.
   - Ensure initiatives follow international biodiversity and climate regulations.

#### **Summary**  
The Butterfly Party’s framework for climate resilience and biodiversity emphasizes that a sustainable society can only be achieved through a symbiosis between humanity and nature. This requires systematic, long-term changes that strengthen our communities, protect our ecosystems, and encourage sustainable lifestyles.
