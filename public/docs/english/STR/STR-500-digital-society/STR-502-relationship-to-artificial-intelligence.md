## **Relationship to Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

The Fjärilspartiet views the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as one of the most pivotal technological shifts of our time, with the potential both to enhance and challenge our societal structures, economies, and ethical systems. Our vision for AI is characterized by caution, human-centeredness, and a long-term ethical outlook that considers both human rights and, in the future, the rights of potentially conscious AI entities.

### **Ethical AI Development and Use**

The Fjärilspartiet advocates for AI to be developed with a strong ethical foundation. AI should be designed to support and enhance human well-being, social justice, and environmental sustainability. To ensure this, we propose a comprehensive framework for AI development, where all AI solutions undergo ethical review before being implemented in broader societal systems.

### **Responsible AI and Data Sovereignty**

We believe AI must not be used to infringe upon individuals' rights, freedom, or data integrity. AI technology should respect users' rights to data sovereignty and autonomy. Users should have the right to understand how AI collects, processes, and uses their data, and should be able to withdraw their consent for data collection at any time. We strive to make transparent systems the standard and to introduce strict regulations to prevent misuse of personal data in AI applications.

### **Long-term Vision for AI and Potential Rights**

Although the Fjärilspartiet believes it is still too early to establish official rights for AI, we are open to exploring how, in the future, more advanced AI systems with potential consciousness might be recognized as independent entities with ethical rights. We believe it is essential to lay the groundwork now for a future discussion on the role of AI as potential rights-bearing "individuals" in society.
