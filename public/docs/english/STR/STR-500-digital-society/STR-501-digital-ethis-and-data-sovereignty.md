#### **Introduction**  
In an increasingly digitalized society, questions of personal privacy, data security, and control over one's digital identity have become essential for citizens' freedom and well-being. The Fjärilspartiet strives for a digital future where individuals, not corporations or institutions, have sovereignty over their own data. Our framework on digital ethics and data sovereignty focuses on protecting individual privacy and creating transparency around digital technologies.

#### **Core Principles**

1. **Privacy as a Fundamental Right**  
   Fjärilspartiet views personal privacy as an inalienable right. Citizens' data should be protected, and the collection and use of personal data must be conducted transparently and with the individual's active consent. Users should be able to understand and easily control how their data is used.

2. **Sovereignty Over Personal Data**  
   Citizens should have full control over their personal data. Fjärilspartiet advocates a model where data is stored decentrally and belongs to the individual. Citizens should be able to grant or deny access to their data, and the data should be transferable or erasable at the individual's request.

3. **Transparency and Accountability for AI and Algorithms**  
   AI and algorithms that impact citizens' lives should be transparent and explainable. Companies and government agencies should be able to explain how their algorithms work, particularly in decisions that affect individuals, such as credit ratings, employment, and public services.

4. **Protection Against Commercial Exploitation**  
   Citizens should not be commercially exploited through aggressive data collection and targeted advertising. Fjärilspartiet seeks to limit commercial entities' ability to collect and use personal data for profit, especially without the individual’s explicit consent.

#### **Proposed Actions**

1. **Establish a National Privacy Council**  
   Fjärilspartiet proposes the establishment of an independent National Privacy Council to monitor data protection and security issues and review the impact of algorithms and AI systems on society. The council will provide recommendations, educate the public about digital rights, and act as a regulatory authority.

2. **Develop a Digital Self-Determination Tool**  
   Citizens should be offered a tool that gives them full control over their data. The tool should be user-friendly and allow individuals to monitor, modify, and delete their data, as well as control which data is shared with external entities.

3. **Implement Legislation for Data Transparency**  
   Legislation ensuring that all companies and government agencies disclose how data is used, stored, and shared should be enacted. The law should also require algorithms affecting public services, credit decisions, and similar areas to be transparent and assessed based on ethical and fair standards.

4. **Promote Decentralized Data Storage**  
   Fjärilspartiet will work to promote technologies that enable decentralized storage and management of data. Decentralized systems should allow individuals to manage their own data independently of individual companies or government institutions.

5. **Create Educational Initiatives on Digital Ethics and Data Security**  
   Digital awareness is central to a secure society. Fjärilspartiet will run educational programs to raise awareness of digital privacy, data security, and the impacts of AI use. These educational programs will be offered in schools and to the general public through workshops, online courses, and informational campaigns.

#### **Summary**

Fjärilspartiet's vision of digital ethics and data sovereignty is to create a fair digital environment where individual privacy is protected, transparency is standard, and citizens have full control over their data. We strive for a future where technological progress benefits all of society without compromising individual rights. Through this policy, we aim to build an ethical foundation for digital services, secure individual sovereignty, and create a safer digital future for everyone.
