# Adaptive Universal Basic Income System (AUBI)
## A Systems-Based Approach to Economic Security and Societal Development

### Core Principles

#### 1. Universal but Adaptive
- Everyone receives a baseline amount unconditionally.
- Additional support varies based on:
- Individual circumstances
- Life situations
- Local cost of living
- Verified contributions to society

#### 2. Needs-Based Components

**Basic Security Layer**
- Unconditional minimum amount for all adults.
- Ensures real economic freedom and dignity.
- Adjusted for local cost of living.
- Portable across municipalities.
- Enables personal growth and risk-taking.

**Individual Adjustment Factors**
- Health condition
- Disabilities
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Educational purposes
- Age-related needs
- Geographical location

#### 3. Recognition of Contributions

**Types of Valuable Contributions**
- Community service
- Environmental stewardship
- Care work
- Cultural activities
- Knowledge sharing
- Innovation and research
- Volunteering
- Local development initiatives

**Verification Methods**
- Community validation
- Municipal oversight
- Digital tracking systems
- Regular review process

### Implementation Framework

#### 1. Payment Structure

**Baseline Payment**
- Starts at 15,000 SEK/month (adjustable).
- Paid to all adult citizens and permanent residents.

- Automatically adjusted for inflation.
- Designed to cover:
* Housing: 5,000-8,000 SEK
* Nutritious food: 3,000-4,000 SEK
* Utilities: 1,000-1,500 SEK
* Transportation: 1,000-1,500 SEK
* Personal needs: 1,000-1,500 SEK

**Needs-Based Supplements**
- Up to an additional 5,000 SEK/month.
- Based on verified individual circumstances.
- Regularly reviewed and adjusted.
- Clear qualification criteria.
- Special focus on:
* Medical needs
* Disabilities
* Geographic costs
* Family caregiving

**Contribution Recognition**
- Up to an additional 3,000 SEK/month.
- Based on verified contributions.
- Flexible and tailored to local needs.
- Transparent criteria.

#### 2. Financing Mechanisms

**Primary Sources**
- Automation Dividend
* Redistributes the value of technological development to society.
* Enables fair sharing of productivity gains.
* Creates incentives for sustainable automation.

- Resource Taxes
* Land value tax
* Natural resource extraction
* Environmental impact
* Data exploitation

- Financial Instruments
* Transaction tax
* Speculation tax
* Currency trading fees
* Carbon pricing

**Systemic Savings**
- Reduced bureaucracy through simplified administration.
- Prevention of social issues.
- Improved health outcomes through reduced stress.
- Increased social cohesion.
- Lower crime rates.
- More efficient resource utilization.

#### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

**Relation to Current Benefits**
- Replaces basic unemployment benefits.
- Complements disability support.
- Coordinates with the pension system.
- Retains specialized support programs.

**Tax System Integration**
- Coordinates with progressive taxation.
- Reduces marginal tax rates.
- Simplifies the tax system.
- Maintains work incentives through gradual tapering.

### Economic Dynamics

#### 1. Circular Effects
- Increased purchasing power stimulates the local economy.
- Strengthened demand creates jobs.
- Enhanced economic resilience.
- Reduced economic insecurity.

#### 2. Innovation Effects
- Enables risk-taking and entrepreneurship.
- Promotes creative development.
- Supports lifelong learning.
- Facilitates career transitions and skill development.

### Systemic Safeguards

#### 1. Integrity of the Baseline Amount
- The baseline of 15,000 SEK is unconditional and unrestricted.
- Existing legal frameworks for guardianship apply if needed.
- Voluntary financial counseling and education available to all.
- Support services for individuals with addiction issues.

#### 2. Quality Assurance of Contribution Supplements
**Verification Process for Social Contributions:**
- Transparent documentation via the DPOP platform.
- Multi-party verification from various societal actors.
- Rotating verification responsibilities to prevent bias.
- Focus on actual societal impact rather than time tracking.
- Clear appeals process.
- Regular evaluation of criteria and processes.

**Risk Management:**
- AI-supported analysis to detect systematic abuse.
- Random audits of documentation.
- Regular review of verification processes.
- Transparent reporting on system efficiency.

#### 3. Fair Needs Assessment
**Objective Criteria:**
- Standardized assessment tools for various need categories.
- Professional evaluation for complex needs.
- Regular re-evaluation of individual situations.
- Clear documentation of decisions.
- Structured appeals process.

**Support Systems:**
- Guidance for navigating the support system.
