# Adaptive Tax Framework  
## A System-Based Approach to Sustainable Welfare Financing  

### Core Principles  

1. **System-Based Assessment**  
   - Holistic understanding of taxation's role in societal systems  
   - Integration between tax collection and welfare financing  
   - Analysis of feedback loops between economic, social, and environmental systems  
   - Continuous evaluation of systemic effects  
   - Adaptive adjustments based on measured outcomes  

2. **Purpose-Driven Design**  
   - Ensuring AUBI financing (base amount of 15,000 SEK)  
   - Creating incentives for positive societal contributions  
   - Supporting the transition to sustainable practices  
   - Promoting innovation and societal development  
   - Balancing individual freedom and collective responsibility  

3. **Evidence-Based Implementation**  
   - Data-driven decisions on tax rates and structures  
   - Transparent monitoring of effects  
   - Regular evaluation of goal fulfillment  
   - Systematic analysis of side effects  
   - Ongoing system optimization  

### Financing Components  

#### 1. Primary Revenue Sources  
**Automation Tax**  
- Taxation of automated production  
- Redistribution of technological productivity gains  
- Progressive scale based on the degree of automation  
- Incentives for socially responsible automation  

**Resource Taxes**  
- Fees on natural resource usage  
- Environmental impact taxes  
- Land value taxes  
- Data extraction tax  

**Financial Instruments**  
- Transaction tax on financial markets  
- Speculation tax on short-term holdings  
- Currency trading fees  
- Carbon pricing  

#### 2. Dynamic Tax Rates  
```python  
def calculate_effective_tax_rate(base_tax, factors):  
    """  
    Calculates the effective tax rate based on various factors  
    
    Parameters:  
    base_tax: Base tax rate  
    factors: Dictionary of influencing factors and their values  
    """  
    
    societal_contribution = sum(factors['positive_contributions'])  
    environmental_impact = factors['environmental_effects']  
    social_impact = factors['social_effects']  
    
    # Adjust based on factors  
    adjusted_tax = base_tax  
    adjusted_tax -= societal_contribution * 0.05  # Reduction for positive contributions  
    adjusted_tax += environmental_impact * 0.1    # Increase for negative environmental impact  
    adjusted_tax += social_impact * 0.08  # Adjustment for social impact  
    
    # Ensure reasonable limits  
    return max(min(adjusted_tax, base_tax * 1.5), base_tax * 0.5)  
```

        self.base_tax_rates = {}  
        self.contribution_registry = {}  
        self.environmental_data = {}  
        self.social_indicators = {}  
    
    def calculate_total_funding(self):  
        """Calculates total funding for AUBI and other welfare systems"""  
        total_funding = 0  
        required_aubi = self.population * 15000 * 12  # Annual AUBI cost  
        
        # Calculate from various sources  
        automation = self.automation_tax()  
        resource_tax = self.resource_taxation()  
        financial_tax = self.financial_transactions()  
        
        return total_funding >= required_aubi
