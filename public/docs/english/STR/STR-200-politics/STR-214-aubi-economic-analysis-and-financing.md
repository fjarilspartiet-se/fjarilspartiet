# AUBI - Economic Analysis and Financing
## A Realistic Path to Implementation

### 1. Summary

AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income) represents a comprehensive welfare system reform. With the increased base amount of 15,000 SEK, a more thorough and systematic implementation is required. This updated analysis presents a robust path forward through:
- Strategic phase division
- Diversified financing
- Systemic savings
- Circular economic effects
- Socioeconomic gains

### 2. Basic Cost Analysis

#### 2.1 Full-Scale Implementation
**At full rollout:**
- Adult population: ~8 million people
- Base amount: 15,000 SEK/month
- Need-based supplement: up to 5,000 SEK/month
- Additional benefits: up to 3,000 SEK/month

**Annual Costs, Basic Cost Calculation:**
1. Base Cost
   * Number of adults: 8 million people
   * Monthly amount: 15,000 SEK
   * Annual cost: 8,000,000 × 15,000 × 12 = 1,440 billion SEK

2. Supplementary Costs
   * Maximum additional amount: 8,000 SEK/month
   * Estimated proportion receiving supplements: 30%
   * Annual additional cost: 8,000,000 × 8,000 × 12 × 0.3 = 230 billion SEK

3. Administration
   * 5% of total cost
   * (1,440 + 230) × 0.05 = 83 billion SEK

Total annual cost: 1,440 + 230 + 83 = 1,753 billion SEK

**Gross Costs:**
- Base cost: 1,440 billion SEK/year
- Supplementary cost: ~230 billion SEK/year
- Administrative costs: ~83 billion SEK/year
Total gross cost: ~1,753 billion SEK/year

**Net Costs after Tax Return:**
- Tax revenues from AUBI (~32%): 461 billion SEK/year
- Effective net cost: ~1,292 billion SEK/year

#### 2.2 Phased Implementation

**Phase 1: Pilot Project (Years 1-2)**
- 10,000 participants
- Base amount: 15,000 SEK
- Annual cost: ~2.2 billion SEK
- Focus: System validation and impact assessment

**Phase 2: Regional Expansion (Years 3-4)**
- 100,000 participants
- Base amount: 15,000 SEK
- Annual cost: ~22 billion SEK
- Focus: Scaling and process optimization

**Phase 3: National Establishment (Years 5-7)**
- Gradual expansion to full scope
- Quarterly increase in participant numbers
- Continuous system optimization
- Gradual integration with existing systems

### 3. Revised Financing Model

#### 3.1 Diversified Revenue Sources

**Primary Sources:**
1. **Automation Tax - Calculation Model:**
  - Base tax: 5% on company revenue
  - Automation surcharge:
    * Calculated based on productivity per employee
    * Increases progressively with automation degree
    * Example: A company with 100 million SEK revenue
      - Base tax: 5 million SEK
      - High automation (+50%): 2.5 million SEK extra
      - Very high automation (+100%): 5 million SEK extra

- Covers: AI systems, robotics, automated services
- Progressive scale based on automation level
- Expected revenue: 400-500 billion SEK/year
- Ethical aspect: Fair distribution of technological gains

2. **Resource Taxation**
- Natural resource extraction: 150-200 billion SEK/year
- Data mining and usage: 100-150 billion SEK/year
- Land value tax: 150-200 billion SEK/year
- Environmental fees: 100-150 billion SEK/year
Total expected revenue: 500-700 billion SEK/year

3. **Financial Transactions**

**Financial Transaction Tax - Calculation Model:**
1. Stock Market
   * Tax rate: 0.1% of transaction value
   * Example: A stock trade of 100,000 SEK yields 100 SEK in tax

2. Bond Market
   * Tax rate: 0.05% of transaction value
   * Example: A bond of 1 million SEK yields 500 SEK in tax

3. Derivatives Market
   * Tax rate: 0.02% of transaction value
   * Example: A derivative contract of 10 million SEK yields 2,000 SEK in tax

Expected revenue: 200-250 billion SEK/year

#### 3.2 System Savings and Efficiency Gains

**Direct Savings:**
- Administrative efficiency: 100 billion SEK/year
- System integration: 80 billion SEK/year
- Digitalization: 50 billion SEK/year
Total direct savings: 230 billion SEK/year

**Indirect Savings:**
1. **Health-related**
- Reduced healthcare costs: 80 billion SEK/year
- Preventive effects: 60 billion SEK/year
- Mental health improvements: 40 billion SEK/year

2. **Social Effects**
- Reduced crime: 40 billion SEK/year
- Improved education: 30 billion SEK/year
- Increased social cohesion: 20 billion SEK/year

3. **Economic Effects**
- Increased entrepreneurship: 50 billion SEK/year
- Innovation and development: 40 billion SEK/year
- Local economic growth: 30 billion SEK/year

### 4. Implementation and Control

#### 4.1 Economic Control Mechanisms

**System for Economic Stability:**
1. Inflation Management
   * Regular monitoring of price trends
   * Automatic adjustment of base amount as needed
   * Stabilizing measures when inflation exceeds target level

2. Budget Balance
   * Quarterly review of revenue and expenditure
   * Activation of reserve funds if needed
   * Adjustment of tax parameters as necessary
   * Implementation of savings measures in case of deficits

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

A full-scale AUBI system requires comprehensive financing that can only be achieved through a combination of diverse revenue sources and significant system changes. A gradual implementation over 7-10 years provides:
1. Opportunity to test and validate effects
2. Time for tax changes to be implemented
3. Space for system adaptations
4. A safer path to full implementation

The revised financing model for AUBI with a base amount of 15,000 SEK is feasible through:
1. Diversified and fair financing
2. Extensive system efficiencies
3. Significant indirect savings
4. Robust implementation and control
5. Proactive risk management
