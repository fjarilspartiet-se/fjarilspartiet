# AUBI - Economic Analysis and Financing
## A Realistic Path to Implementation

### 1. Summary

AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income) represents a comprehensive welfare system reform that requires a well-thought-out and gradual implementation. This revised analysis presents a realistic path forward through pilot projects, gradual scaling, and diversified financing.

### 2. Basic Cost Analysis

#### 2.1 Full-scale Implementation
**At full rollout:**
- Adult population: ~8 million people
- Base amount: 12,000 SEK/month
- Supplement: up to 7,000 SEK/month
- Total annual cost: ~1,488 billion SEK

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Base cost: 1,152 billion SEK/year
- Supplementary costs: 336 billion SEK/year
- Administrative costs: ~5% of total cost

#### 2.2 Phased Implementation
**Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Pilot Project**
- Scope: 10,000 participants
- Base amount: 8,000 SEK/month
- Annual cost: ~1 billion SEK

**Phase 2 (Years 4-6): Regional Rollout**
- Scope: 100,000 participants
- Base amount: 9,000 SEK/month
- Annual cost: ~11 billion SEK

**Phase 3 (Years 7-10): National Establishment**
- Gradual increase to full scale
- Incremental increase of the base amount
- Gradual implementation of supplements

### 3. Revised Financing Model

#### 3.1 Diversified Revenue Sources

**Primary Sources:**
1. **Automation Fee (5%)**
   - Broadened definition of automation
   - Covers: Industrial robots, AI systems, automated services
   - Expected revenue: ~87 billion SEK/year
   - Gradual implementation over 5 years

2. **Resource Tax (5%)**
   - Natural resource extraction
   - Forestry
   - Water resources
   - Expected revenue: ~100 billion SEK/year

3. **Digital Business Tax**
   - Platform economy
   - Digital services
   - AI/ML usage
   - Expected revenue: ~80 billion SEK/year

4. **Financial Transaction Tax**
   - 0.1% on stock trades
   - 0.05% on bond trades
   - Expected revenue: ~60 billion SEK/year

**Secondary Sources:**
1. **Environment-related Taxes**
   - Extended carbon tax
   - Environmental fees
   - Expected revenue: ~90 billion SEK/year

2. **Progressive Wealth Tax**
   - Above a certain wealth level
   - Graduated scale
   - Expected revenue: ~70 billion SEK/year

#### 3.2 System Savings

**Direct Savings:**
- Administrative efficiency: ~60 billion SEK/year
- Integration of existing support systems: ~40 billion SEK/year
- Digitalization of processes: ~20 billion SEK/year

**Indirect Savings:**
- Improved public health: ~50 billion SEK/year
- Reduced crime: ~20 billion SEK/year
- Increased entrepreneurship: ~30 billion SEK/year

### 4. Implementation Plan

#### 4.1 Pilot Phase (Years 1-3)
**Scope:**
- 3-5 different municipalities
- 10,000 participants in total
- Focus on various demographic groups

**Funding:**
- Research grants
- Municipal co-financing
- Government pilot funds
- Total budget: ~3 billion SEK

#### 4.2 Regional Expansion (Years 4-6)
**Scope:**
- Expansion to entire regions
- 100,000 participants
- Integration with local systems

**Funding:**
- Initial tax reforms
- Regional co-financing
- System savings
- Total budget: ~33 billion SEK

#### 4.3 National Rollout (Years 7-10)
**Gradual Expansion:**
- Annual increase in participant numbers
- Incremental increase of base amount
- Phased implementation of all components

**Funding:**
- Full implementation of tax model
- Realization of system savings
- Integration with state budget

### 5. Risk Management and Adaptation

#### 5.1 Economic Risks
- Inflation impact
- Labor market effects
- Tax evasion
- International competitiveness

**Countermeasures:**
- Continuous economic monitoring
- Flexible adjustment mechanisms
- International cooperation
- Robust monitoring system

#### 5.2 System Risks
- Technical challenges
- Administrative bottlenecks
- Unanticipated behavioral changes
- Political stability

**Handling:**
- Extensive testing systems
- Backup procedures
- Behavioral research
- Broad political anchoring

### 6. Evaluation and Development

#### 6.1 Continuous Evaluation
- Quarterly follow-ups
- Annual in-depth analyses
- Independent research studies
- International comparisons

#### 6.2 Adaptation Mechanisms
- Automatic adjustments
- Policy adjustments
- Amount adjustments
- System updates

### 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

A fully scaled AUBI system requires extensive financing, achievable only through a combination of various revenue sources and significant system changes. A gradual implementation over 7-10 years provides:

1. The opportunity to test and validate effects
2. Time for tax changes to be implemented
3. Room for system adjustments
4. A safer path to full implementation

The recommendation is to:
- Start with a small-scale pilot project
- Develop and test financing models
- Build broad political and societal support
- Ensure robust evaluation and adaptation
