# Individual Autonomy and Personal Development as a Social Right

## Introduction

In a society that values human dignity, it is fundamental that each individual has the freedom and resources to develop according to their own choices and values. This document describes our vision of a society where all people have genuine opportunities for self-determination and personal development, regardless of their starting point or chosen life path.

## Vision

A society where:
- Individuals have real freedom to shape their lives
- Basic security enables personal choices
- Diversity in life choices is respected and supported
- Barriers to personal development are actively removed
- Different types of contributions to society are valued

## Goals and Measures

### 1. Create Conditions for Self-Determination
- Ensure economic security through AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income)
- Provide access to education and personal development
- Support access to resources for various life choices
- Enable flexible working and living arrangements

### 2. Remove Barriers
- Identify and eliminate structural obstacles
- Combat discrimination and prejudice
- Ensure accessibility to society’s resources
- Support people in transitions and changes

### 3. Support Diversity in Life Choices
- Acknowledge and respect different lifestyles
- Create space for alternative ways of living
- Support cultural and social diversity
- Promote mutual understanding and respect

### 4. Enable Social Participation
- Create flexible forms of contribution to society
- Value various types of community involvement
- Support grassroots initiatives and local engagement
- Promote knowledge and experience sharing

## Implementation

### Societal Structural Changes
- Develop flexible support systems that respect individual choices
- Create platforms for resource-sharing and collaboration
- Promote local initiatives and communities
- Support experimental and alternative solutions

### Concrete Forms of Support
- AUBI as a foundation for real freedom of choice
- Access to education and skills development
- Support for different housing options and lifestyles
- Resources for personal and professional growth

### Evaluation and Development
- Regular monitoring of support systems’ effectiveness
- Ongoing dialogue with various social groups
- Adaptation to changing needs and opportunities
- Research on barriers and enabling factors

## Conclusion

By focusing on creating opportunities and removing obstacles, rather than defining what is valuable for the individual, we aim for a society where everyone has a real chance to develop and contribute in their own way. This requires both structural changes and concrete forms of support, but above all, a fundamental respect for individual autonomy and the right to self-determination.
