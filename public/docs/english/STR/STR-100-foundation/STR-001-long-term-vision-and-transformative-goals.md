### Introduction

Fjärilspartiet envisions a future where society has progressed beyond many of today’s limitations and conflicts, toward a world marked by openness, justice, and human fulfillment. This vision offers a compass for long-term social transformation, founded on democratic, ecological, and social values. We strive for a society where every individual can live a meaningful, self-expressive life without the constraints of poverty, violence, or institutional oppression.

The long-term vision is divided into three main goal areas: *Domestic Society*, *International Integration*, and *Social and Technological Evolution*.

### Vision for Domestic Societal Goals

1. **No Crime**  
   By strengthening education, social support, and human development, our goal is to eliminate the root causes of crime. This requires a thorough restructuring of how we address social issues, with a clear, humanitarian focus on preventive measures.

2. **No Resource Shortages**  
   We aim for a future where natural resources and technology are used sustainably, ensuring every individual has access to essential necessities like food, water, housing, and healthcare.

3. **Individual Fulfillment**  
   Society should promote every person’s opportunity to explore their potential. We advocate for educational reforms and cultural changes that support individual identity and unique expression.

4. **Minimal Necessary Governance**  
   In a society where these conditions are met, the state can gradually transition to a minimal but supportive role. Fjärilspartiet envisions a future where government functions as a facilitator rather than a ruling force, providing governance tailored to people’s needs and circumstances.

### International Vision

1. **Freedom from War and Conflict**  
   Our long-term goal is a world where all forms of war and armed conflict are outdated, achieved through diplomacy, cultural exchange, and global cooperation.

2. **Economic Justice Among Nations**  
   We advocate for a fair global economic system where all countries have equal opportunities for growth and development, with resource distribution based on human and ecological values.

3. **Global Citizenship and Freedom of Movement**  
   We believe in a world where every individual has the opportunity to move freely between nations, and where global citizenship grants everyone equal rights and freedoms. This concept would give individuals a sense of belonging and responsibility on a global scale, while preserving cultural and local autonomy.

4. **Adaptive Global Governance**  
   Fjärilspartiet envisions an adaptive governance model developed to address international issues, respecting national and cultural characteristics while meeting common human and ecological goals.

### Social and Technological Evolution

1. **Social Development to Eliminate Crime**  
   We advocate for social development that eradicates crime by creating social structures that meet people’s fundamental needs and offer every individual the chance to feel included and valued.

2. **Resource Abundance through Technology**  
   Through innovative technology and sustainable practices, we can create a future society without resource shortages. The focus is on local self-sufficiency and advanced technologies that regenerate and recirculate resources.

3. **International Scientific and Technological Collaboration**  
   Science and technology should be fostered as shared human endeavors, not as tools of national competition. Fjärilspartiet works for global collaboration in research areas such as disease prevention, climate improvement, AI, and space exploration.

4. **Cultural and Individual Development**  
   By supporting art, creativity, and education, Fjärilspartiet will work to enhance individuals' ability to achieve self-actualization. This includes developing culture and values to create a meaningful society.

### Implementation and Measurement

1. **Short-Term Actions**  
   Implementation of specific initiatives and projects to advance the goals outlined above, such as reforms in education, social support, and sustainable resource use.

2. **Medium-Term Actions**  
   Further development of strategic international partnerships, strengthening technological innovation, and expanding international aid programs to ensure economic justice.

3. **Long-Term Actions**  
   Creation of shared international institutions and tools that enable harmonious and sustainable global coexistence, with continuous adaptation to meet new needs and technological advances.

4. **Evaluation and Continuous Improvement**  
   Regular evaluations to monitor progress toward the goals and ensure that strategies continue to align with our long-term vision.

### Summary

Fjärilspartiet’s long-term vision is bold and ambitious, guiding all our strategies and decisions. It grounds our policy in a fundamental belief in humanity’s potential for peace, prosperity, and self-fulfillment, and calls for changes that extend far beyond today’s structures. We invite every individual and community to be part of this transformative journey.
