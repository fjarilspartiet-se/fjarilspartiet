### Core Ethical Tenets

1. Respect for All Forms of Existence  
   - Equally Alive, Equally Essential: This principle affirms the interdependence of all entities, challenging traditional boundaries that separate "alive" from "non-alive." All beings and systems are considered part of a larger, interwoven fabric, and each has intrinsic value.
   - Evolving Ethical Coherence: Ethics should reflect a dynamic respect for entities based on their role in this interconnected web. The aim is not only to protect what we conventionally see as "life" but to respect systems, environments, and patterns integral to a healthy, balanced existence.

2. Non-Hierarchical Respect for Life and Non-Life  
   - Unified Value Approach: The value of life or non-life is viewed through the lens of relational importance rather than intrinsic hierarchy. Human, ecological, mineral, or synthetic entities are seen as part of an ongoing cycle, where existence supports mutual flourishing.
   - Adaptive Practices for Ethical Coexistence: This principle encourages practical approaches that minimize harm. For example, favoring low-impact sustenance (e.g., gathering fruits, nuts) and promoting renewable or circular resources whenever feasible.

3. Balancing Individual Needs with Collective Good  
   - Personal and Shared Well-Being: The “common good” aligns with the flourishing of the individual. Policies and practices should allow both individuality and community to thrive without imposing an undue burden on either.
   - Non-Consumptive Pathways: This principle supports exploring and adopting practices that lessen the reliance on consumptive or exploitative relationships, aiming toward a balanced, reciprocal exchange between entities.

4. Responsibility within Systems
   - Closed Systems with Open Potential: Recognizing that existence is self-regulating, we aim to ensure our actions align with this closed system’s tendencies, which often favor interdependence, balance, and minimal waste.
   - Ethics of Reversible Impact: Actions should aim to be reversible, or at the very least, remedial, considering that true freedom respects the continuity and well-being of interconnected systems.

5. Principle of Allowance and Tendency
   - Ethical Allowance: While existence is all-allowing in its tendencies, Fjärilspartiet’s ethics encourage choices that foster harmony and respect within this broad allowance. This does not limit innovation or personal freedom but steers it toward balance.
   - Systemic Tendency Awareness: Recognize and respect the tendencies inherent within systems. Policies should reflect an understanding of these patterns to harmonize with them rather than disrupt.

### Practical Ethical Commitments

1. Minimal Disruption to Natural Systems
   Policy: Support ecological initiatives that promote regrowth, balance, and minimal interference in natural cycles.  

2. Flexibility in Ethical Models
   Policy: Allow for context-sensitive ethical applications, embracing diversity in ethical reasoning that adapts to different cultural, environmental, and individual needs.

3. Commitment to Non-Exploitative Technologies
   Policy: Invest in and endorse technologies that minimize consumption, support circular economies, and operate with the lowest ecological impact possible.

4. Guidelines for Personal and Social Development
   Policy: Encourage practices that foster self-reflection, empathy, and awareness, equipping individuals with tools to make ethical decisions that respect the broader web of existence.

5. Integrated Ethical Education
   Policy: Develop educational programs to support Fjärilspartiet’s philosophy, focusing on interconnected ethics, practical sustainability, and holistic responsibility.

This ethical framework would create a basis for policies and actions grounded in a philosophy of connectedness, respectful existence, and adaptive coexistence—seeking harmony across all life, non-life, and emergent forms. How does this align with the essence of Fjärilspartiet as you envision it?
