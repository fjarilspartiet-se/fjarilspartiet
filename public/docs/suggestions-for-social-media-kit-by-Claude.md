You're absolutely right! Having more visual assets would significantly enhance your social media presence and message sharing. With only 4 SVGs plus the logotype, you might find yourself limited when creating varied content across platforms.

Here are some additional SVG concepts that would complement your existing collection and textual messages:

### Suggested Additional SVGs

1. **AUBI Infographic** - A simple visual explaining how AUBI works with three components (base amount, needs supplement, contribution supplement) using icons and minimal text.

2. **Systems Thinking Visualization** - Interconnected circles or a web showing how different aspects of society connect, reinforcing your holistic approach.

3. **Transformation Timeline** - A visual representation of the four stages (egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly) with brief descriptions of societal parallels.

4. **Local Resilience Icons** - A set of simple icons representing local food systems, community building, and sustainable practices.

5. **Quote Templates** - Minimalist templates with your butterfly logo where you can add quotes from your text templates.

6. **Democratic Innovation Illustration** - Visual showing how digital democracy tools connect citizens to decision-making processes.

7. **Values Icons Set** - Simple icons representing core values (freedom, community, meaning, connection) in your distinctive style.

8. **Social Media Profile Frames** - Frames featuring your logo and colors that supporters can add to their profile pictures.

9. **"Join Us" Template** - An engaging visual invitation to join the party with clear call-to-action.

10. **Data Visualization Templates** - Simple charts/graphs for sharing evidence-based information about AUBI effects.

### Implementation Strategy

For efficient use of these visuals:

1. **Create a consistent visual system** - Use the same color palette, typography, and style across all graphics
2. **Design for different platforms** - Prepare variants in different aspect ratios (square for Instagram, landscape for Twitter/Facebook)
3. **Pair specific visuals with corresponding text templates** - For example, the AUBI infographic pairs well with your AUBI-related text templates
4. **Create both static and animated versions** where possible for greater engagement

Would you like me to develop concepts for any of these additional SVGs in more detail? I'd be happy to create more visual assets to support your communication strategy.
